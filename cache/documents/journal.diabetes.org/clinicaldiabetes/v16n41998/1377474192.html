    </center></div><p>Multiple studies in a variety of primary care settings show poor
    compliance with the American Diabetes Association&#146;s (ADA) guidelines for the
    management of diabetes mellitus.<sup>1-4</sup> Foot examination was documented in as few
    as 6% of the charts in a managed care plan<sup>3</sup> to a maximum of 48% in a
    Veteran&#146;s Administration (VA) primary care clinic.<sup>4</sup> Similarly, at least
    one hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> measurement within 1 year was documented in as few as 16% of
    Medicare recipients with diabetes mellitus,1 44% in managed care,<sup>3</sup> and 84% in a
    VA primary care clinic.<sup>4</sup></p>
    <p>As other national programs, such as the Diabetes Quality Improvement Program, set
    standards of care for patients with diabetes mellitus, increasing pressure will be placed
    on primary care physicians to comply with these standards. Compliance may be a difficult
    task for busy primary care physicians.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this article is to show how the important clinical indicators for
    diabetes mellitus can be effectively tracked and documented in a primary care office. We
    will briefly discuss why diabetes is a difficult disease for a primary care physician to
    manage. We will then explore how clinical guidelines in general, and those for diabetes
    specifically, can best be implemented. Finally, we will suggest ways of improving diabetes
    care in a primary care office. </p>
    <p><strong>Barriers to Care<br>
    </strong>For many reasons, diabetes is a difficult disease for primary care physicians to
    manage. To make this task easier, barriers to care must first be identified and then
    overcome. The barriers are both general to the management of chronic diseases and specific
    to diabetes mellitus.</p>
    <p>Chronic disease is difficult to manage for five reasons. First, as the complexity of
    treatment protocols and the number of treatment options increase, compliance on the part
    of doctors decreases. As a corollary, if the amount of work for clinicians increases,
    compliance with guidelines will decrease. The ADA guidelines are complex. In recent years,
    the number of treatment options has increased as new drugs have been introduced. Just 5
    years ago, the only treatment options were diet/exercise, oral sulfonylureas, and
    injectable insulin. Today, there are five different classes of oral agents.</p>

    </center></div><p>Second, physicians must track multiple clinical indicators over time.
    Table 1 shows the 11 parameters that are the basis for the Provider Recognition Program,
    which is cosponsored by the ADA and the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA).
    Typical paper medical records are not well-suited for documenting compliance. Without a
    systematic approach to tracking these parameters, they can easily be missed or lost in a
    paper medical record.</p>
    <p>Third, primary care physicians are under increasing time constraints. A typical visit
    to a family physician or general internist is between 15 and 20 minutes long. In this
    time, the physician must address not only the parameters listed in Table 1, but also other
    acute and chronic problems that may be present. Patients with diabetes also have other
    preventive health needs, such as screening for colorectal or breast cancer, that must also
    be tracked.</p>
    <p>Fourth, diabetes is not the only disease that primary care physicians address, and
    patients with diabetes do not represent the majority of their patients. Diabetes is one of
    many chronic diseases that primary care physicians treat. Primary care physicians have
    guidelines not only for diabetes, but also for multiple other chronic diseases, such as
    congestive heart failure, asthma, and depression. Juggling the requirements of each set of
    guidelines can be very difficult. In locations where there are several different managed
    care organizations, each plan may have its own guidelines, as well as its own formulary.
    Primary care physicians can become rapidly overwhelmed by the multiple guidelines and
    formularies.</p>
    <p>And fifth, the present health care system is set up for acute, episodic care, rather
    than for preventive care. Until recently, many insurers did not even pay for many
    preventive services.</p>
    <p>In addition to the system factors mentioned above, Hiss<sup>5</sup> identified another
    barrier specific to the care of patients with type 2 diabetes. Many patients and
    physicians do not consider or treat type 2 diabetes as a serious health problem. Terms
    such as &quot;touch of sugar&quot; or &quot;watch your weight&quot; are used. Many
    physicians believe that their patients&#146; diabetes is an issue of lifestyle factors,
    and if patients would only lose some weight, the problem would be resolved.</p>
    <p><strong>How to Implement Guidelines Successfully<br>
    </strong>Despite the numerous barriers in caring for individuals with diabetes, there are
    many ways in which care can be improved. Two recent systematic reviews have addressed
    adoption and implementation of clinical guidelines.<sup>6,7 </sup></p>
    <p>Wensing and associates<sup>7</sup> grouped interventions into information transfer
    (reading materials, group education, patient education), information linked to performance
    (feedback, reminders, patient reminders), learning through social influence (individual
    instruction, peer review groups, patient reports), and management support (resources,
    incentives, rules/obligations, patient incentives). They found that the most effective
    single interventions were information linked to performance and learning through social
    influence. Information transfer and management support were effective or partly effective
    in less than half of the studies examined. Multiple interventions were usually more
    effective than single interventions.</p>
    <p>Davis and Taylor-Vaisey<sup>6</sup> also examined the theoretical concepts and research
    evidence for changing physicians&#146; behavior and reported similar findings. They
    grouped the interventions into weak, moderately effective, and relatively strong
    interventions. The groupings shown in Table 2 form a useful framework for examining
    interventions specific to implementing diabetes clinical guidelines.</p>
    <p>Weak interventions include lecture-based Continuing Medical Education (CME), such as
    conferences and seminars, and unsolicited mailed materials. While these interventions are
    the least effective, they are the most common ways that organizations disseminate their
    guidelines. They are a necessary step in the implementation of guidelines, but by
    themselves they are insufficient.</p>
    <p>No studies have examined the effect that CME as the sole intervention has on diabetes
    care. However, Stolar<sup>8</sup> examined the impact of the ADA practice guidelines in
    university endocrinology teaching programs. He reported numerous deficiencies in all
    aspects of care that did not significantly improve following publication of the 1989 ADA
    guidelines. The only exceptions were in the areas of foot care, eye examination, and lipid
    screening. This contrasts with the perception by approximately two-thirds of the fellows
    that care had changed. Only one-third of the fellows were aware of the guidelines before
    the study began.</p>
    <p>Moderately effective interventions include audits and feedback. Gohdes and associates<sup>9</sup>
    reported on a system in which regional primary care physician coordinators using
    standardized parameters measured implementation and provided feedback to care providers
    within the Indian Health Service. Improved rates of pneumococcal vaccination, yearly
    comprehensive foot exam, and improved blood pressure control were demonstrated.</p>
    <p>Relatively strong interventions include reminder systems, academic detailing, and
    multiple interventions. There are several reports of the successful use of reminder
    systems in diabetes care. In a review of British and Australian studies, Griffin and
    Kinmonth<sup>10</sup> reported that a computerized recall system for both patients and
    general physicians led to outcomes (hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub>, mortality, follow-up) as
    good as or better than those at hospital-based specialty clinics. Nilasena and associates<sup>11</sup>
    reported that a computer-generated reminder system for diabetes preventive care provided
    an average of <sup>13</sup> recommendations to bring the patient&#146;s care into
    compliance with their defined standards. In general, residents were satisfied with the
    system and felt that it led to improved quality of care and had a beneficial effect on
    long-term outcomes. Lobach and Hammond<sup>12</sup> reported that their computer-generated
    patient management recommendations resulted in a twofold increase in clinician compliance
    with their diabetes guidelines. Median compliance for the group receiving the
    recommendations was 32.0% versus 15.6% for the control group. And, finally, Smith and
    colleagues<sup>13</sup> reported on the use of a real-time computerized diabetes registry
    in a subspecialty diabetes clinic. Comparing the care given by subspecialists using either
    the paper record or the real-time system, they found statistically significant
    improvements in the number of blood pressures per patient per year, number of foot
    examinations per patient per year, and percentage of patients with four hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub>
    measurements per year in the group using the real-time system.</p>

    </center></div><p>One of the authors (RIH) has reviewed the use of voice interactive
    response systems.<sup>14</sup> This appears to be a safe and effective enhancement to an
    endocrinologist&#146;s diabetes practice. Patients using the system experienced a
    reduction in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> of 1.3% from a baseline of 10.2%, while hemoglobin
    A<sub>1c</sub> remained unchanged in the nonuser group. A reduction in frequency of
    hypoglycemia was also found, as was a reduction in frequency of office visits. Further
    studies are needed to confirm a similar experience in the primary care setting.</p>
    <p>The Internet offers great potential for tracking diabetes but has not been fully
    implemented or tested. McKay and associates<sup>15</sup> present a view of things to come
    with their report of an Internet support service for diabetes self-management.</p>
    <p>While many health systems have disease management programs for diabetes that employ
    multiple interventions, such as academic detailing and computerized reminder systems, this
    approach has not been systematically studied. Peters and Davidson<sup>16</sup> did report
    the successful use of a program using a computerized tracking/recall system and
    nurse-administered protocols in a managed care system. The median hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub>
    fell from 11.9% to 8.8% in compliant patients and was maintained over the 3-year study.
    Compliance with the performance of lipid profiles, foot exams, and ophthalmology referrals
    also significantly improved and were &gt;90% in all three categories. </p>
    <p><strong>A Method for Success<br>
    </strong>In order to improve care, multiple approaches are needed to implement change.
    These approaches also need to become part of everyday practice if sustained change is to
    occur. </p>
    <p>The feasibility of each of the following suggestions will depend on the practice
    setting. Offices without a computerized reminder system may find pocket cards and flow
    sheets easy and effective to implement, while other practices may have the resources to
    implement a computerized tracking system or an electronic medical record with decision
    support. The initial step is to recognize the need to improve and to make a conscious
    effort to change. </p>
    <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Set standards.</strong> Set standards for your office. Get
    &quot;buy-in&quot; by involving other practitioners in the decision. Pick a few key
    standards, and then expand the number. It is better to start with a few things and be
    successful than to try to do too much and fail. The ADA guidelines are a good place to
    start and are available on the Internet <br>
    ( <a href="http://www.diabetes.org/DiabetesCare/Supplement198/default.htm">http://www.diabetes.org/DiabetesCare/Supplement198/default.htm</a>
    ).</p>
    <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Involve patients.</strong> Get patients involved in their
    care. Dickey and Petitti showed that patient-held mini-records improved compliance with
    preventive services.<sup>17</sup> Develop a recall system for patients. This can be as
    simple as a diabetes &quot;tickler&quot; file for important parameters of care or as
    sophisticated as a computerized recall system.</p>
    <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Involve staff.</strong> Office staff can be trained to
    perform a variety of tasks. Train nursing staff to review medical records for preventive
    services. Nurses can attach a note to the front of the record file to remind busy
    clinicians of the need for yearly ophthalmologic or foot examinations. Staff can remind
    patients to remove their shoes and socks at every visit. Ensure that the nursing staff
    records patients&#146; weight and blood pressure at each visit. There is usually a wait
    between the time a patient is placed in an examination room and the time the provider
    steps in. Train the nursing staff to use this time for reviewing basic diabetes education.

    </center></div><p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Develop office tools.</strong> Develop
    office tools, such as pocket cards or flow sheets, to aid clinicians. Dartnell and
    colleagues<sup>18</sup> demonstrated improvement in the initiation of anticoagulation
    using pocket-sized laminated cards. In our own system, we provide pocket cards to all
    primary care providers (Figure 1). One part of the card contains information about
    medications, including starting and maximum dosages, indications, and contraindications.
    Because there are more than six managed care plans in our area, we also include formulary
    recommendations. Another portion of the card, called &quot;The &#145;SOAP&#146; of
    diabetes,&quot; presents key points, such as screening recommendations, target goals, and
    treatment suggestions. </p>

    </table>
    </center></div><p>Develop a flow sheet that incorporates your office standards. Tracking
    diabetes in a paper chart record can be difficult. Time is lost culling through previous
    visits or searching through laboratory data. This task can be even more difficult with a
    patient who has other medical problems. One simple way to improve access to important
    parameters is to gather all important data into a flow sheet. An example is shown in
    Figure 2. There are also blank spaces in this flow sheet to add other preventive measures,
    such as mammography or hemoccult testing.</p>
    <p><strong>5. Use your practice environment.</strong> There are two times that patients
    commonly wait: in the waiting room and in the exam room before the clinician arrives.
    Place educational materials or posters in your waiting room. We have a patient education
    bulletin board in each of our exam rooms. We rotate the material every 2 months. Put a
    sign in the exam room stating &quot;If you have diabetes, please remove your shoes and
    socks before your health care provider arrives.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>6. Use every opportunity. </strong>Patients with diabetes visit physicians for
    acute problems as well as for routine follow-up of their chronic problems. Use visits for
    acute problems as opportunities to review preventive recommendations for diabetes.</p>
    <p><strong>7. Monitor compliance.</strong> Audits and feedback are effective agents for
    changing physicians&#146; behavior. Organize a periodic audit of the charts of patients
    with diabetes. When deficiencies are identified, deal with them at the time of the audit
    or attach a note to them as a reminder of actions that need to be addressed at the
    patient&#146;s next visit.</p>
    <p><strong>Conclusion<br>
    </strong>Despite the barriers to improving diabetes care, there are numerous approaches to
    overcoming these obstacles. Improving the care of patients with diabetes can be considered
    a journey. A journey starts with a step. This article suggests numerous steps in the
    journey toward improving care in both small and large organizations. </p>
