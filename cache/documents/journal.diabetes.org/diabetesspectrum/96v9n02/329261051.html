<p>Diabetes medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is defined as a
four-step model that includes assessment of an individual&#146;s
metabolic and lifestyle parameters, identification of nutrition
goals, intervention designed to achieve these goals, and
evaluation of clinical outcomes.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Nutrition practice guidelines for insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus (IDDM) (see article by Splett and Leontos on p. 128) and
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)<sup>2</sup> have
been developed to increase the quality and consistency of
diabetes MNT. Diabetes educators can use these guidelines to
anticipate and simplify the decision-making process and foster
improved metabolic control. The practice guidelines provide a
framework that can assist diabetes educators in the nutrition
assessment, goal setting, intervention, and evaluation of
outcomes of diabetes MNT for people with IDDM and NIDDM.<br>
<br>
<strong>Nutrition Assessment: A Definition<br>
</strong>Although assessment is the initial step of the four-step
model, beginning the relationship or establishing rapport with a
client is an important preliminary step. Usually, this begins
during the assessment phase and continues throughout the
educational process, to develop a genuine and trusting
relationship between diabetes educator and client.</p>

<p>Nutrition assessment is the most crucial step in diabetes MNT.
The assessment forms the basis for developing the intervention
plan and identifying potential changes to a client&#146;s
lifestyle and health habits that will improve health. The main
purpose of an assessment is to gather information needed to
assist in the development of individual nutrition goals and
subsequently establish an appropriate nutrition intervention.<br>
<br>
<strong>Preliminary Data</strong><br>
Before diabetes educators can conduct a comprehensive nutrition
assessment, they must collect preliminary data, either from a
hospital or clinic medical record or from a referring physician.
The data needed for review includes health service utilization,
type of diabetes, current treatment regimen, laboratory values,
current medications, risk assessment for complications, previous
diabetes education, current nutrition therapy, guidelines for
exercise, the physician&#146;s diabetes management goals, and the
client&#146;s self-management needs.</p>

<p>In some clinical circumstances, information about previous
diabetes education and current nutrition therapy, guidelines for
exercise, physician&#146;s goals for the client, and the
client&#146;s self-management needs is not available in the
medical record and may not be included in a referring letter from
the physician. This information would then become part of the
data gathered in the nutrition assessment.<br>
<br>
<strong>Components of a Nutrition Assessment</strong><br>
The major components of a nutrition assessment are collection of
clinical data, nutrition history, weight history, physical
activity history, monitoring, psychosocial and economic issues
(including stress and social support), knowledge, skill level,
readiness to change, and barriers to learning.2 Table 1 contains
the nutrition assessment components and specific data to be
considered at the initial assessment visit. </p>

<p>Dietitians must obtain and use information from all these
components to develop achievable goals and workable interventions
appropriate to each client. Assessment is ongoing, and is
continuously modified and updated throughout the diabetes MNT
process.</p>

<p>Dietitians cannot cover all of these assessment components
in-depth in the initial session with their clients. The amount of
time it takes to do an assessment varies widely and depends on
the dietitian, the client, and other factors, such as the
client&#146;s ability to provide information, as well as the
complexity of information needed.</p>

<p><strong>Resources</strong><br>
Many different tools and resources are available to assist in the
gathering and development of a comprehensive nutrition
assessment. In 1993, a steering committee of the American
Diabetes Association and The American Dietetic Association set
out to identify nutrition-related diabetes resources in need of
updating, as well as new products for development.</p>

<p>One of the resources developed by a work group of this
steering committee was <em>Facilitating Lifestyle Change</em>: A <em>Resource
Manual</em>. The manual consists of a series of resource forms
developed to assist in promoting lifestyle change. The lifestyle
change process identifies four steps that correspond to the
four-step model of diabetes MNT&#151;assessment, goal setting,
intervention, and evaluation. One of the resources in this
manual, the Lifestyle Questionnaire, was designed primarily as an
assessment tool. The questionnaire contains seven sections, which
coincide with the nutrition assessment components listed in Table
1. These sections are described below.<br>
<br>
1. <em>Do You Want To Change Your Lifestyle?</em><br>
This section helps ensure that a client&#146;s expectations are
compatible with the anticipated clinical outcomes that have been
established. It also helps focus attention on areas of
information that the client is most receptive to learning, as
well as assisting in establishing a priority list for learning
needs (Figure 1). <br>
<br>
2. <em>Nutrition History</em><br>
This section helps assess: <br>
&#149; past nutrition interventions<br>
&#149; previous meal planning methods used and self-assessment of
comprehension and compliance<br>
&#149; household/family situation<br>
&#149; eating away from home issues (provides additional insight
on social, financial, and lifestyle considerations)<br>
&#149; alcohol intake (provides additional insight about habitual
use and contribution toward excess calories, elevated
triglyceride levels, and glycemic control)<br>
&#149; intake of nutrition supplements (potential for
drug/nutrient interaction; often not reported to a physician in
an assessment of medications)<br>
&#149; compulsive eating issues<br>
<br>
3. <em>Food Record Form</em><br>
This form can be used to collect and assess nutrition history
information, most often gathered as a usual food intake or
24-hour food recall. This allows the educator to see common
trends in food intake. It would not take into account day-to-day
variability, so having a client self-monitor using this form for
several days or using an additional nutrition history assessment
tool, such as a food frequency questionnaire, would be necessary
to make a more accurate evaluation.</p>

<p>If the form is used as a food record, it is important to
instruct clients in properly recording their food intake, such as
determining portion size, describing food preparation, and
listing all food ingredients (e.g., fat used to season vegetables
or specific components of a mixed dish, salad, or sandwich).</p>

</center></div>

<p><br>
<br>
4. <em>Weight History</em><br>
This form is designed for use with clients for whom weight loss
is the primary desired clinical outcome. However, the words
&quot;weight change&quot; were chosen instead of &quot;weight
loss&quot; to make this form more appropriate as a tool for
assessing anyone&#146;s weight. The specific components of the
weight history form include: <br>
&#149; usual weight, weight history, and healthy weight goal<br>
&#149; readiness-to-change assessment<br>
&#149; expectations regarding weight change<br>
<br>
5. <em>Physical Activity History</em><br>
This form assesses current activity level, readiness to become
more physically active, and types of physical activities of
interest.<br>
<br>
6. <em>Stress History</em><br>
This section assesses a client&#146;s current level of stress,
the ways a client reacts to stress, and the client&#146;s need
for education and counseling in stress management.<br>
<br>
7. <em>Record-Keeping History</em><br>
This section assesses previous experience with self-monitoring
(e.g., food records, exercise records, or blood glucose
monitoring). This information may help in assessing a
client&#146;s interest level and the level of complexity for
participation in self-monitoring.<br>
Other components to consider in completing an initial nutrition
assessment (Table 1) include clinical data, knowledge and skill
level, and readiness to change.</p>

<p><em>Clinical data</em>. The information needed to gather
clinical data such as body mass index (BMI), reasonable body
weight, and daily energy needs is well known to most diabetes
educators and is readily available in many resources. A list of
these resources is included in the Suggested Reading section of
this article.</p>

<p><em>Knowledge and skill level</em>. Many dietitians/diabetes
educators have developed their own checklists or surveys to
assess a client&#146;s knowledge of nutrition. Table 2 provides
an example of a knowledge checklist specific to diabetes MNT.
Another method to assess knowledge is to compare client
information collected from nutrition questionnaires and a verbal
nutrition history with established goals or standards for
education.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p><em>Readiness to change.</em> The transtheoretical model for
behavioral change developed by Prochaska and associates provides
a framework for assessing readiness to change using a five-stage
model.4 These stages include: 1) Precontemplation = no intention
to change in the foreseeable future; 2) Contemplation = aware
that a problem exists, thinking about making a change; 3)
Preparation = decision making; 4) Action = making changes; 5)
Maintenance = working to prevent relapse.</p>

<p>These stages of change have been applied to a variety of
health behavior interventions, including fat reduction, exercise,
smoking cessation, alcohol treatment, self-monitoring of blood
glucose, and weight control.<sup>5</sup> In the Lifestyle
Questionnaire, readiness-to-change questions are included in both
the Weight History and Physical Activity History sections. The
questions and responses are worded as follows:</p>

<p>Are you interested in working to change your weight?<br>
&#151; Yes, right now.<br>
&#151; No, I can&#146;t right now.<br>
<br>
<br>
&#151; No, but I will think it over.<br>
&#151; No, not now.<br>
&#151; No, I&#146;m not interested.<br>
<br>
Are you interested in becoming more physically active?<br>
&#151; Yes, right now.<br>
&#151; No, I can&#146;t right now.<br>
&#151; No, but I will think it over.<br>
&#151; No, not now.<br>
&#151; No, I&#146;m not interested.<br>
<br>
Movement through these five stages often involves a move in
either direction. Focusing intervention on the appropriate stage
can facilitate tailoring intervention to the client&#146;s needs,
thus improving the likelihood of success. Assessment of readiness
to change can guide diabetes educators in negotiating with
clients to establish behavior change goals.<br>
<br>
<strong>Collecting Assessment Data</strong><br>
The two most common barriers to obtaining assessment data in
clinical practice are time limitations and clients&#146;
reluctance to provide information. Some solutions that may help
maximize time include:<br>
&#149; Use data previously collected by other staff.<br>
&#149; Focus on assessment information that is the most pertinent
to the client.<br>
&#149; Prioritize information by obtaining the most crucial
information first.<br>
&#149; Provide clients with forms or questionnaires to be
completed before their visits (i.e., at the initial visit to
complete for a subsequent visit, in the mail before the next
scheduled visit, or in the clinic or office waiting room before
their visit).<br>
<br>
Some ways to help maximize the information clients provide
include:<br>
&#149; Take time to develop rapport and establish trust with
clients.<br>
&#149; Ask questions and respond to answers in a nonjudgmental
way. There are no wrong or bad answers.<br>
&#149; Respect clients&#146; emotional state, which may require
waiting to obtain comprehensive assessment data.<br>
<br>
<strong>Summary<br>
</strong>Nutrition assessment serves an educational purpose for
diabetes educators and clients because it can improve a
client&#146;s awareness of health status, treatment options, and
lifestyle factors that affect health. Nutrition assessment also
provides diabetes educators with an opportunity to set the tone
of their relationships with clients. Ideally, diabetes educators
and clients should develop a working partnership.</p>

<p>Diabetes educators should ask not only for information, but
also for a client&#146;s reactions, feelings, and thoughts about
the information being discussed. This starts a natural
progression into the next step of the four-step model of diabetes
MNT&#151;goal setting.</p>

educators can refer to <em>Diabetes Medical Nutrition Therapy: A
Professional Guide</em>, which will be published later this year

Association.<br>
