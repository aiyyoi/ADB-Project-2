            Although assessing QoL is methodologically complex, valid and reliable tools are available

            as part of a monitoring procedure is advocated. </font></td>

    certainty as to the origin of the term <i>Quality of Life</i> (QoL), but American
    economists Samuel Ordway (1953) and Fairfield Osborn (1954) are probably the first to have
    used the concept, expressing their concern over the ecological dangers of unlimited
    economic growth.<sup>1,2</sup> A few years later, John Galbraith's influential book <i>The
    Affluent Society</i> was published (1958), followed by <i>The Industrial State</i> (1967),
    in which he criticized the economic ideology of industrial expansion, stating &quot;What
    counts is not the quantity of our goods but the quality of life.&quot;<sup>3,4</sup>
    American President Lyndon B. Johnson expressed this view in almost identical words at a
    1964 political meeting, stating &quot;Goals cannot be measured by the size of our bank
    account. They can only be measured in the quality of lives that our people lead.&quot; </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">In the 1960s, social scientists became more
    interested in the issue of quality of living, and particularly in the relationship between
    economic and social indicators of life quality on one hand, and the subjective evaluation
    of these circumstances on the other. Data from this Social Indicators Research suggested
    that the major determinants of high subjective quality of life are positive, close, and
    stable social relationships. In addition, the smaller the gap between expectations and
    achievements (or objective circumstances), the greater the level of reported happiness. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Physical health appeared not to be a strong
    predictor of people's subjective well-being. In their 1976 study on the quality of
    American life, for example, Campbell and associates found that almost half of the people
    who reported disabilities severe enough to prevent them from doing &quot;a lot of
    things&quot; were unwilling to say that they were dissatisfied in any degree with their
    health, and a small number of them even insisted that they were completely satisfied with
    it.<sup>5</sup> The relationship between objective indices of wealth and health and the
    subjective evaluations of these circumstances appeared to be weak, implying that it takes
    more than improving people's physical circumstances to enhance their subjective quality of
    life. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Partly under the influence of the
    aforementioned changes in the social climate and partly as a result of changes within the
    field of medicine, patients' subjective well-being gained growing recognition in medical
    care and research. In the post-World War II period, new medical technologies were
    introduced that dramatically increased patients' life expectancy, i.e., life
    &quot;quantity,&quot; but not necessarily life quality. There was a growing need for
    standards by which the benefits and risks of new medical treatments could be evaluated,
    including patients' subjective evaluations. A new area of medical research was introduced.
    With the growing number of patients suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, care
    rather than cure became the focus of medical treatment,<sup>6</sup> and this development
    has caused a shift in clinicians' thinking about benefits, risks, and costs of medical
    interventions. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">It was not until 1976 that the concept of
    QoL was included as a keyword in the <i>Index Medicus</i>, initially under the subheading
    &quot;Philosophy.&quot; Since the early 1970s, the concept has become increasingly
    popular, and numerous studies have been published on QoL in different areas of medicine,
    including diabetes. Studies on QoL are basically performed for two reasons.<sup>7</sup>
    First, they are conducted to evaluate the psychosocial functioning of (somatic) patient
    groups and to identify specific problems and needs of patients at different stages of the
    disease process. Second and most often, QoL studies are conducted to compare the impact of
    different treatment regimens on the patients' well-being and treatment satisfaction. Such
    comparative studies may provide clinicians with important information to support clinical
    decision making, taking both biomedical and psychosocial aspects into consideration. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">By 1999, more than 300 English-language
    articles on QoL in diabetes had been published in international peer-reviewed medical
    journals, the majority of which concerned type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes. </font></p>
    </div><div><b><p></b><font size="3"><strong>The Concept of Quality of Life</strong><br>
    What is meant by the term <em>quality of life</em>? How is it defined? This is not an easy
    question to answer and has led to much controversy in the past years. To complicate the
    discussion, the terms <em>quality of life</em>, well-being, health status, and
    satisfaction are often used interchangeably. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Hï¿½rnquist defines quality of life as a
    broad spectrum of dimensions of human experience, ranging from those associated with the
    necessities of life, such as food and shelter, to those associated with achieving a sense
    of fulfillment and personal happiness.<sup>8 </sup>To narrow the scope to aspects of
    functioning directly related to the disease and/or medical treatment, the term <i>health-related
    quality of life</i> (HRQoL) was introduced.<sup>9</sup> Walker and Rosser<sup>10</sup>
    define QoL in the medical setting as &quot;a concept encompassing a broad range of
    physical and psychological characteristics and limitations, which describe an individual's
    ability to function and to derive satisfaction from doing so.&quot; Spitzer suggests that
    the term <i>health status </i>should be reserved for assessments that discriminate along a
    continuum beginning with &quot;perfect health.&quot;<sup>11,12 </sup>He advocates that
    health-related or health-sensitive measures of QoL be used to quantify and describe
    attributes among those who are &quot;definitely sick.&quot; QoL in this context refers to
    health-related problems, including the impact of disease and treatment on functioning,
    health beliefs, and subjective well-being. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">While no consensus has been reached on the
    definition of the concept, most researchers would agree that QoL <i>a)</i> is a
    multidimensional construct, encompassing aspects of psychological, social, and physical
    well-being, and <i>b)</i> should reflect the patient's subjective evaluation of well-being
    rather than the health care professional's view. The problem of defining QoL is often
    resolved by taking the &quot;psychometric short-cut,&quot; i.e., by operationalizing the
    construct as a score on a questionnaire or set of scales, in the same way intelligence is
    defined as a score on the IQ test.<sup>13</sup> </font></p>
    </div><div><b><p></b><font size="3"><strong>Assessment of QoL</strong><br>
    Following the definition of HRQoL, assessment should be based on patients' self-report and
    should cover the relevant domains of daily functioning (physical, mental, social) for a
    particular disease and/or treatment regimen. In diabetes, relevant domains of QoL may
    include symptom distress, general physical functioning, mental/emotional state, social
    functioning, perceived burden of the treatment regimen, treatment satisfaction, and an
    overall sense of well-being.<sup>14</sup> </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">In past years, various generic and
    disease-specific QoL instruments have been developed for research purposes. Generic
    measures of QoL, e.g., the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP)<sup>15</sup> or the Short Form-36
    Health Survey,<sup>16 </sup>allow for comparison across groups of patients with different
    diseases. However, such general measures may contain items or domains that have little or
    no relevance to a specific patient group, or conversely, lack specific items or domains
    that would seem typically relevant to that disease entity. The specificity of
    disease-specific questionnaires is an obvious advantage, but at the same time diminishes
    the possibility of comparison to other diseases. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">To ensure comparability of QoL outcomes
    across different patient groups, it is advised to include a generic QoL instrument along
    with a disease-specific questionnaire. Various diabetes-specific QoL measures have been
    introduced, both for type 1 and type 2 patients, that differ in specific content and focus
    of attention. These include the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) scale,<sup>17</sup> the
    Diabetes Health Profile (DHP),<sup>18</sup> the Diabetes Quality of Life Question-naire
    (DQOL),<sup>19</sup> the Diabetes Care Profile (DCP),<sup>20</sup> the Diabetes-39,<sup>21</sup>
    the Diabetes Symptom Checklist-type 2 (DSC-2),<sup>22</sup> and, most recently, the Audit
    of Diabetes Dependent QoL or ADDQoL.<sup>23</sup>. For more information, see the article
    by William Polonsky on diabetes-related QoL in this issue (<a href="pg36.htm">p. 36,
    Understanding and Assessing Diabetes-Specific Quality of Life</a>). </font></p>
    </div><div><b><p></b><font size="3"><strong>Measurement Problems</strong><br>
    In QoL research, complex psychometric problems are encountered that are not always fully
    appreciated by clinicians and researchers. Too often, it seems, the validity and
    reliability of QoL instruments are taken at face value, partly as a consequence of the
    fact that funding opportunities for psychometric research are limited. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Validity refers to the question of whether
    an instrument measures what it is intended to measure. In the case of QoL, validity is not
    easy to determine, because there is no &quot;gold standard&quot; for life quality.
    However, different aspects of validity, e.g., content, convergent, and discriminant
    validity, can be used to substantiate the psychometric validity of a scale. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><i><p></i><font size="3"><em>Content validity</em> refers to
    whether an instrument samples all relevant topics. When developing a QoL questionnaire for
    a specific patient group, it may be extremely helpful to invite experts and patients to
    critically review the content. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><i><p></i><font size="3"><em>Convergent validity</em> refers
    to whether the QoL scale relates (converges) with other measures of related constructs
    (e.g., emotional well-being, mood). </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><i><p></i><font size="3"><em>Discriminant validity</em> is
    demonstrated by no or low correlations between the scale and measures of clearly
    dissimilar constructs (e.g., intelligence). Sometimes, discriminative validity is referred
    to as &quot;extreme groups validity,&quot; reflecting the instruments' ability to classify
    or discriminate between distinct groups of patients on the basis of differences in scores.
    </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Reliability refers to the reproducibility of
    the finding, i.e., whether a measure produces similar results in a given situation.
    Reliability is of critical importance in QoL research, given the various confounders
    related to the methodology of self-report questionnaires. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">An extensive review of the methodological
    problems in QoL research is beyond the scope of this article. Useful handbooks on the
    subject, such as Bradley's compendium<sup>24</sup> and Streiner and Norman's practical
    guide<sup>25</sup> are available for those with an interest in psychometrics. Here we will
    highlight some of the lesser-known psychometric issues encountered in QoL research. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><i><p></i><font size="3"><em>Self-report</em>. QoL research
    strongly relies on self-reports, i.e., subjective evaluations of people's functioning. It
    is important to note that in this context the term subjective, as opposed to objective,
    does not mean &quot;soft&quot; or unreliable, as is often assumed, but refers to the
    source of information: the subject. Subjective data can be obtained using reliable,
    objective methodologies for that purpose. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">However, as Schwarz points out, self-reports
    are a fallible source of data, and minor changes in question wording, format, or context
    can result in major changes in the obtained results.<sup>26</sup> For example, when asked
    how often they experienced a variety of physical symptoms, 62% of a psychosomatic patient
    group reported symptom frequencies of more than twice a month when the response scale
    ranged from &quot;twice a month or less&quot; to &quot;several times a day.&quot; Yet,
    only 39% reported frequencies of more than twice a month when the scale ranged from
    &quot;never&quot; to &quot;more than twice a month.&quot;<sup>27 </sup>When developing a
    QoL instrument or evaluating an existing questionnaire, item content, wording, format, and
    scaling are critical issues to consider. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">In addition to emotional well-being, QoL
    research may include assessment of (changes in) patients' satisfaction with treatment,
    which is often found to be high, thus leaving little room for improvement. The highly
    skewed scores present a psychometric problem known as a &quot;ceiling effect.&quot;
    Adapting the range of value labels (e.g., by adding &quot;excellent&quot; or
    &quot;extremely satisfied&quot;) may overcome the ceiling effect and help to improve the
    instrument's responsiveness to change in satisfaction.<sup>28 </sup></font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><i><p></i><font size="3"><em>Preference.</em> QoL is often
    studied in randomized, controlled trials, in which patients cannot always be blinded to
    the different features and demands of the treatment modalities under study (e.g., pump
    therapy vs. multiple injections). Patients may have strong preferences for a particular
    treatment at the start of the trial, and this preference may (consciously or not)
    influence the patient's adherence to and consequently effectiveness of the treatment
    regimen. The problem of patient preference does seem to warrant a different experimental
    approach, taking initial preferences into account, rather than assuming that they play no
    role.<sup>29</sup> </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><i><p></i><font size="3"><em>Adaptation.</em> An issue of
    interest in QoL studies is the fact that patients tend to adapt cognitively, emotionally,
    and behaviorally to changes in their physical status. The phenomenon of psychological
    adaptation is illustrated in studies showing that cancer patients do not necessarily
    report lower well-being levels than healthy control subjects.<sup>30</sup> We all know
    from daily life that people have a tendency to adapt to changing circumstances and to make
    the best of their lives. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">The weak relationship between people's
    objective health status and their appreciation of life quality may be explained at least
    in part by adaptation or &quot;habituation,&quot; a phenomenon that has also been observed
    in people whose circumstances have definitely improved, such as lottery winners, who do
    not necessarily report an improvement in well-being.<sup>31 </sup>In diabetes patients,
    psycho-physiological adaptation to elevated blood glucose is known to exist and can act as
    a barrier to glycemic improvement. Despite poor glucose control, patients may feel
    reasonably good and are therefore not inclined to intensify their treatment regimen. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><i><p></i><font size="3"><em>Response-shift</em>. In trials
    evaluating QoL using a pre-post test design, it is assumed that the respondents' internal
    standard of self-rating does not change in the course of the study, thus permitting
    comparison of QoL scores before and after the intervention. However, cognitive adaptation
    may occur as a result of the intervention itself and bias the outcome of QoL research.<sup>32</sup>
    </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">This response-shift phenomenon was first
    observed in studies evaluating the effects of personal skills trainings using a
    conventional pre-post test design.<sup>33</sup> People joining a training may initially
    over- or underestimate their personal skills, and at postcourse assessment evaluate their
    skills from a different, and in fact more realistic, internal norm. In case of
    overestimation at the beginning of the course, comparison of the scores pre- and
    postcourse would suggest that the intervention had no effect or even a negative effect on
    the respondent's personal skills. Likewise, we know that type 2 diabetes patients can
    retrospectively (i.e., after having experienced a significant improvement in physical
    health due to intensified treatment) discover that they were not in such good shape as
    they believed to be at the time. (&quot;Doc, I didn't know I could feel this
    energetic!&quot;) </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">In research, patients may over- or
    underestimate their well-being or satisfaction at the start of a clinical trial, thereby
    masking the real (beneficial) effects of a new therapeutic device or treatment regimen. A
    potentially effective strategy to tackle the problem of response-shift in QoL research is
    to administer a retrospective pretest, after patients have completed the posttest.
    Instruct patients to look back at the start of the trial and rate their well-being at that
    time point as they perceive it now. By applying this so-called &quot;now-then&quot;
    approach, you can ensure that subjects' subjective evaluations before and after the
    intervention are made from the same internal standards.<sup>34</sup> Of course, this
    approach has the problem of being subject to demand characteristics, so that patients may
    assume they must be better off now than before. </font></p>
    </div><div><b><p></b><font size="3"><strong>QoL and Glycemic Control </strong><br>
    One of the most intriguing findings from QoL research is the relatively weak association
    between patients' objective health status and their subjective life quality. Apparently,
    health in itself does not guarantee happiness, nor does good glycemic control. Studies
    looking into the relationship between diabetes control (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and subjective
    well-being find low correlations, if any,<sup>35-37 </sup>although there is evidence to
    suggest that patients suffering from diabetes-related complications (neuropathy,
    retinopathy, nephropathy) on average report lower levels of QoL compared to patients
    without secondary complications.<sup>38,39</sup> </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">One could argue that perceived QoL should
    not necessarily agree with objective parameters of metabolic control (e.g., HbA<sub>1c</sub>),
    because laboratory measures do not translate into tangible physical sensations unless
    values are in the extreme range. Also, the benefits of improved glycemic control may be
    outweighed by the perceived burden of intensive self-management that is required to
    achieve strict glycemic control. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">The relationship between QoL and glycemic
    control is complex, as is shown in Figure 1. Basically, four combinations of QoL and
    glycemic control can be observed in patients with diabetes. While some patients experience
    good QoL in conjunction with good glycemic control (A), others report satisfactory QoL
    despite poor glycemic control (B). Patients in the latter group may &quot;deny&quot; their
    diabetes, allowing them (at least temporarily) to enjoy life without having to bother too
    much about their diabetes and the treatment regimen. In some patients, poor QoL exists
    despite good metabolic control (C). This may be related to the burden of having to
    self-manage diabetes on a day-to-day basis. It may be a consequence of other life stresses
    unrelated to the diabetes. Poor glycemic control and poor QoL may coincide in patients,
    often negatively affecting each as both cause and effect of poor diabetes control.</font></p>

    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Large, prospective studies such as the
    Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)<sup>40</sup> and the U.K. Prospective
    Diabetes Study (UKPDS)<sup>41</sup> have researched the impact of intensification of
    treatment in diabetes on QoL and overall found no evidence for an adverse effect of strict
    glucose control on patients' well-being. This should come as no surprise and may well be
    related to the process of adaptation discussed above. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Alternatively, the QoL results may be biased
    by a lack of specificity and/or sensitivity of the instruments used to quantify changes in
    QoL. For example, in the DCCT, a threefold increase of episodes of severe hypoglycemia was
    not found to be associated with a decrement in reported life quality, using the DQOL.<sup>42</sup>
    This finding seems counterintuitive given the major impact that severe hypoglycemia can
    have on patients' emotional and social well-being.<sup>43</sup> </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Interestingly, a significant correlation was
    found in the DCCT between rates of severe hypoglycemic episodes and scores on the Symptom
    Check-list-90-R, a global severity index of psychological distress,<sup>44</sup> but cause
    and effect are difficult to determine here. Jacobson and associates<sup>45</sup> found a
    consistent negative association between psychiatric symptoms and diabetes-related QoL
    using the DQOL. This finding may reflect a negative bias in cognitions in patients with
    psychiatric symptoms, such as depression. Indeed, in studies in type 2 diabetic patients
    performed by our research group, &quot;neuroticism&quot; explained 10% of the variance in
    well-being scores, and diabetic symptom scores correlated significantly with the level of
    depression.<sup>46,47 </sup></font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">These findings point out the importance of
    the individual coping process as mediator or moderator between diabetes as stressor on the
    one hand and QoL outcomes and glycemic control on the other. Including coping in our
    research model may help us to better understand the observed inter-individual differences
    in QoL among patients suffering from the same illness. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Coping generally implies successful
    adaptation, but in health psychology research, the term refers to specific cognitive and
    behavioral acts (coping responses) used by individuals to decrease a perceived threat and
    its associated stress responses or to solve illness-related adaptive tasks.<sup>48 </sup>Research
    suggests that the way patients cope with the stresses of diabetes is determined by a
    complex interaction of individual characteristics (e.g., gender, age, socioeconomic
    status, personality), social support received from significant others, and important life
    events (e.g., loss of a job, divorce, becoming a parent, death of a loved one).<sup>49,50</sup>
    </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">In this transactional stress-coping model of
    diabetes, subjective QoL is regarded as an adjustment outcome, next to glycemic control
    (Figure 2). To enhance patients' subjective QoL, in addition to optimal medical treatment,
    educational and behavioral interventions aimed at facilitating the patients' coping with
    diabetes may prove helpful.<sup>51,52</sup> </font></p>

    In recent years, QoL has been recognized as an important outcome of medical treatment and
    has become a core issue in diabetes care. Numerous clinical studies have been conducted to
    evaluate the impact of diabetes and different treatment modalities on patients' subjective
    QoL. Fewer studies have been conducted to explain individual differences in QoL and the
    role of coping. The measurement of QoL involves complex methodological issues related to
    the use of self-reports as the primary source of information, and validity and reliability
    of QoL instruments deserve critical evaluation. </font></p>
    </div><div class="text1011"><p><font size="3">Although generally appreciated as the
    primary goal of diabetes care, patients' QoL is most often not monitored systematically as
    an integral part of diabetes routine control, as recommended in the World Health
    Organization/International Diabetes Federation St. Vincent Action Programme.<sup>53</sup>
    There is still much work to be done in this area. The development of valid, reliable, and
    user-friendly QoL assessment procedures can help to facilitate the actual integration of
    QoL measurement in diabetes care. </font></p>
