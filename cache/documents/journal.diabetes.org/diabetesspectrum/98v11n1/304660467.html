    with diabetes in the United States is expected to increase, perhaps by 2 million, as a
    direct result of changes made earlier this year to diabetes screening recommendations and
    diagnostic criteria.1 These revised methods will allow timely diagnosis of diabetes and
    give the health care system an unprecedented opportunity to initiate metabolic control
    before the onset of complications.</p>
    <p>This influx of newly diagnosed individuals is in addition to the 8 million people
    already diagnosed with diabetes. With annual costs related to diabetes exceeding $90
    billion,2 providing efficient and effective diabetes care is increasingly important.</p>
    <p>In 1993, the results of the landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)
    provided clear evidence that metabolic control matters for people with type 1 diabetes.3,4
    This dictum is quickly gaining acceptance for type 2 diabetes, as well.5 But as the debate
    about glycemic control and complications is put to rest, perhaps a more complex and
    controversial issue arises: how can intensive therapy be implemented for increasing
    numbers of people with diabetes?</p>
    <p>Broadly defined, intensive diabetes management aims to achieve optimum glycemic control
    using advanced techniques in insulin therapy, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG),
    nutrition, and behavioral sciences.6 Intensive management is far more than increased
    frequency of monitoring or an additional injection of insulin per day. It requires careful
    follow-up to monitor progress toward individualized goals and support to reinforce
    management skills and personal efforts.</p>
    <p>Such complexities extend beyond the scope of sole practitioners. It is not surprising
    that intensive diabetes management requires a core group of skilled professionals with
    diverse roles, functions, and contributions: the interdisciplinary team.</p>
    <p>The interdisciplinary, integrated care team as a model for the treatment of chronic
    illness is not a new concept. Its benefits have been supported in a variety of
    disorders.7-11 Adoption of this model is relatively new to diabetes, however, and requires
    a shift in how diabetes providers view their roles and relationships, both with patients
    and with professionals in other disciplines.</p>
    <p>Recognition of the complexity of diabetes treatment has prompted both the American
    Diabetes Association and the American Association of Diabetes Educators to endorse team
    management as the ideal model for the delivery of diabetes care.12,13</p>
    <p><strong>Composition of the Diabetes Treatment Team</strong><br>
    The interdisciplinary, integrated diabetes treatment team includes physicians, nurses,
    dietitians, and behavioral scientists with special interest and training in the management
    of diabetes.5 This core membership reflects the basic requirements of diabetes treatment:
    nutrition, medication, self-monitoring, and self-management. Team skills are designed to
    address the regular, recurring needs of most people with diabetes.</p>
    <p>Teams may also extend to health care professionals who can help meet special or
    specific needs not within the scope of the core team&#146;s expertise. For example,
    podiatrists, exercise physiologists, ophthalmologists, pharmacists, or specialists in
    maternal-child care or gerontology may have a place within the diabetes care team.</p>
    <p>The existence of a diabetes care team implies the development of a comprehensive
    diabetes care program ensuring that standards of care are met.5 Care should be
    research-based and outcome-focused. Mutual support of team members will encourage ongoing
    professional development and support of critical thinking skills.14</p>
    <p><strong>Leadership, Roles, and Functions</strong><br>
    Integrated care is defined as patient-centered and goal-directed, with equal emphasis
    given to education, counseling, and medical treatment. (See Table 1.) Key elements of the
    interdisciplinary team include shared leadership with common goals, shared professional
    identity, and collaborative, rather than consultative, relationships among members.15</p>
    <p>The movement toward interdisciplinary care requires changes in team organization. In
    traditional medical models of care, the roles of team members and the work performed by
    each member are defined by the physician. The interdisciplinary model demands a shift
    toward shared leadership,15 which promotes mutual problem-solving, open communication
    among all team members, and team cohesiveness. Undoubtedly, most organizations will still
    be inclined to identify a physician as team leader, but the nature of that leadership role
    must evolve from the traditional physician leadership role.</p>
    <p>The DCCT provided a demonstration of such a change. Initially, the physicians were the
    primary diabetes care givers and directed the day-to-day activities of other team members
    by assigning tasks and responsibilities. As the study progressed, however, the
    physicians&#146; role developed into that of team builder, with emphasis on development of
    ideas, cohesiveness, and problem-solving skills.16</p>
    <p>Santiago noted that the role of physicians in a diabetes treatment team should change
    and that teams should be available to the wider health care system. In his words, the
    physician should be &quot;a team manager who could be replaced without dissolving the
    existing team. Indeed, the team could be organized so that it would serve the needs of
    many physicians, not just the manager, in a given community.&quot;16 Such a circumstance
    has long been standard in physical medicine and rehabilitation.</p>
    <p>In the interdisciplinary model, registered nurses frequently assume the role of care
    coordinator. In other words, although physicians are responsible for the overall medical
    management of patients and are the primary providers for acute medical problems, the
    day-to-day management of the diabetes regimen can be provided by nurses.</p>
    <p>In the DCCT, patients spent more than 80% of their time during follow-up visits with
    nonphysician health care professionals. Patients spent about 60% of their time with
    nurses.</p>
    <p>Responsibilities of diabetes nurse clinicians include but need not be limited to
    providing diabetes education, assisting in the choice of insulin regimen, adjusting
    insulin dosages, teaching patients problem-solving skills, helping patients work through
    self-management problems, and developing educational and motivational strategies to
    promote patients&#146; independent self-management. Coordina-tors are the contact point
    for care, integrating the unique expertise of other disciplines to address patients&#146;
    needs. The role of nurses extends beyond the clinic or hospital. Nurses monitor
    patients&#146; diabetes management and achievement of treatment goals and provide ongoing
    communication between patients and the wider diabetes management team. </p>
    <p>The role of dietitians goes beyond the identification of an appropriate meal plan.
    Working individually with patients to design meal algorithms, dietitians highlight
    appropriate and realistic nutrition and exercise goals, negotiate dietary strategies, and
    provide ongoing patient support, tailoring programs to meet patients&#146; lifestyle,
    motivation, and specific needs. Dietary counseling may include teaching an individual
    alteration of insulin doses for varying food intake.3,17 Ongoing dietitian contact is
    critical; it is inappropriate to restrict dietitian contact to times when a crisis
    requires diet modification.</p>

    </center></div><p>Behavioral scientists (psychologists, social workers, psychiatrists, or
    other mental health professionals) play a pivotal role on the team by identifying barriers
    to diabetes self-management, providing assistance in setting treatment goals, and helping
    patients implement the management skills needed for intensive diabetes treatment.
    Behavioral scientists also provide counseling services regarding adjustment to chronic
    illness and stress management, diagnose psychiatric illness, and screen for learning
    disorders that might interfere with patient comprehension and compliance.</p>
    <p><strong>Collaboration</strong><br>
    Interdisciplinary team care requires the adoption of a shared professional identity.15 In
    the traditional medical model, professionals from each discipline approach diabetes
    treatment from their own professional paradigm. In interdisciplinary care, however,
    members share a common professional identity as a part of the team, as well as a common
    purpose.</p>
    <p>Having a shared professional identity does not suggest that members give up their
    unique contributions as physician, nutritionist, nurse, or behavioral scientist. Rather,
    all members bring specific expertise and a valuable point of view to the group. It does,
    however, call for tolerance and even encouragement of flexible roles within a team.</p>
    <p>One example of nontraditional roles within a team setting would be having insulin
    adjustments made by a nurse, dietitian, or patient, rather than by a physician.18 Routine
    physical examinations and screening for complications may be provided by a nurse or
    medical assistant.18-20 This does not suggest that team members exceed their scope of
    practice, but it does require that all members have a thorough understanding of diabetes
    and its management, be skilled in helping patients identify barriers to self-management,
    and be willing to review competencies periodically.</p>
    <p>Conflicting viewpoints on how to define health and illness stemming from different
    professional paradigms could undermine attempts to develop an integrated,
    interdisciplinary program.21 Teams can identify and address these core conflicts to
    develop an effective team paradigm. Nevertheless, the blurring of traditional roles
    permits greater flexibility within the team and should help make optimum use of health
    care resources.</p>
    <p>The successful shift from consultative, multidisciplinary practice to collaborative,
    interdisciplinary practice requires that members of the team understand the unique nature
    of each discipline represented on the team and respect each discipline&#146;s unique input
    in decision making.22 Collaborative practice allows matching of provider expertise and
    style to specific patient needs and goals.</p>
    <p>If optimal glucose control of a patient&#146;s type 2 diabetes is achieved through diet
    alone, then the dietitian could be that patient&#146;s primary provider. In this
    situation, the dietitian would be responsible for assuring that all standards of diabetes
    care are met for that patient, for coordinating the appropriate referrals to do so, and
    for providing the expert advice on dietary intervention for diabetes self-management.</p>
    <p>Similarly, in patients for whom chronic diabetes complications have become the focus of
    treatment (painful, peripheral neuropathy, for example) medical/pharmaceutical
    intervention may become the focus, and the principal provider may be the physician or
    pharmacist. Likewise, if barriers to achieving diabetes care goals are psychosocial in
    nature, then visits with an appropriate expert in behavior modification or stress
    management may be more helpful than repeated trips to the doctor for a review of blood
    glucose levels.</p>
    <p>The structure of the interdisciplinary team in the DCCT provided a framework for
    addressing progress toward goals. The study group encouraged each clinic treatment team to
    review all aspects of intensive diabetes management when participants were unable to reach
    the glycemic target. The six areas each team was challenged to review included patient/
    team interactions, dietary issues, appropriateness of insulin regimen, psychosocial
    issues, technical proficiency issues, and clinic structure. These periodic reviews,
    conducted during routine staff meetings, allowed all team members to identify problems,
    collaborate on strategies to promote euglycemia while preventing hypoglycemia, and
    mutually agree upon staff-identified priorities that could then be shared or negotiated
    with each patient. </p>
    <p><strong>Outcome Associated With Team Management</strong> <br>
    A growing body of evidence supports the value of integrated, interdisciplinary team
    management for chronic illness. The DCCT is still cited as a model of integrated,
    interdisciplinary team care, and its design, outcomes, and costs have been thoroughly
    described. 16,18,20,23,24 Translating the results as a measure of team care effectiveness
    must be done cautiously, however, because the DCCT was not a test of the team care
    delivery model. In fact, the protocol was initially built on a traditional medical model,
    with physician responsibility for outcomes. Further care was delegated to various team
    members.16,25</p>
    <p>The interdisciplinary model present at the end of the study evolved over time, with the
    recognition that optimal application of intensive diabetes management required a range of
    knowledge, skill, and enthusiasm that is rarely found in one person.16 Roles and function
    evolved, as did respect for the unique input brought by professionals from each
    discipline.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that, by the end of the study, the majority of the care was
    delivered by nonphysician providers,16 which is now deemed appropriate for diabetes
    management.26 This development provides evidence for the benefits of team care as it
    pertains to attaining clear metabolic outcomes.</p>
    <p>The benefits of interdisciplinary team care for people with diabetes was demonstrated
    by Halter and associates in 1993.27 Elderly patients with diabetes were randomly assigned
    to participate either in an intensive insulin treatment program&#151;which included
    insulin management aimed at specific blood glucose targets, a comprehensive diabetes
    education program and a program for social support&#151;or to continue to receive standard
    diabetes care from their usual community resources. Subjects assigned to the intensive
    treatment group were able to significantly improve their glycemic control as compared to
    the standard care group.</p>
    <p>Similar beneficial effects of an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to chronic
    disease management have been demonstrated with conditions other than diabetes. These
    include but are by no means limited to chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue
    syndrome, mental illness, and care of the frail elderly.7-11,27,28</p>
    <p>In two non-randomized studies of chronic pain, interdisciplinary pain management led to
    an improved sense of control over pain and decreased perceptions of pain as interfering
    with activities of daily living. These benefits were achieved despite no lessening of pain
    perception scores.10,28</p>
    <p>Another non-randomized study of injured workers with chronic pain had similar findings.
    In addition, workers who participated in the interdisciplinary pain program were more
    likely to be able to return to work compared to workers who did not receive pain
    management services through the program. Early entry into the program (&lt;1 year after
    injury) was associated with more favorable outcomes.28 </p>
    <p>Integrated care in people with severe mental illness has also been shown to be
    beneficial as compared to traditional intervention models. Participants in integrated,
    interdisciplinary programs were more likely to have worked for pay, more likely to have
    remained in treatment, had shorter and less frequent hospitalizations, had greater social
    support, and had greater client and family satisfaction than did subjects in more
    traditional care models.8,9</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario: A 50-Year-Old Woman With Diabetic Neuropathy</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Part 1: Traditional model of diabetes treatment</strong><br>
    D.L., a 50-year-old woman, presented for treatment of intermittent, painful peripheral
    neuropathy of the upper right thigh. Two years earlier, D.L. noted a rapid onset of pain
    and weakness of the right leg. She went to a neurologist for evaluation of her pain. The
    neurologist told her she had diabetic peripheral neuropathy.</p>
    <p>The patient told the neurologist that she did not have diabetes. Her prescribed
    medications included glyburide and acetaminophen with codeine. The patient consulted with
    her primary care doctor, who in-formed her that she indeed had diabetes and that she was
    started on glyburide 2 years earlier for this reason.</p>
    <p>When she had visited the doctor 2 years earlier, the doctor had told D.L. that she had
    a &quot;high blood sugar level,&quot; but did not specifically use the term diabetes.
    Although she had continued to see her primary care doctor regularly, D.L. was never given
    a diet or exercise plan, and received no diabetes education.</p>
    <p>D.L. was also a smoker, and she did not exercise regularly.</p>
    <p><strong>Part 2: Team management of diabetes</strong><br>
    <em>Initial interventions</em>. D.L. was referred to and completed an outpatient diabetes
    education program that was recognized by the American Diabetes Association. She was also
    referred to a tertiary care diabetes clinic, where she was introduced to a team consisting
    of a diabetologist, a registered nurse who was a certified diabetes educator, a registered
    dietitian, and a social worker.</p>
    <p>On arrival at the clinic, D.L. had an HbA1c level of 9.0% and microalbuminuria. She was
    considering applying for disability because of her painful neuropathy.</p>
    <p>After the initial evaluation, D.L. agreed to work closely with the dietitian on a
    negotiated dietary program using carbohydrate counting. She received SMBG training and was
    asked to fax her blood glucose test results to the nurse every week. The nurse would share
    D.L.&#146;s blood glucose results with other team members in a weekly meeting. The social
    worker discussed the issue of disability with D.L. and her husband. A follow-up
    appointment was scheduled for 1 month.</p>
    <p><em>Follow-up interventions</em>. At the 1-month follow-up visit, D.L. met with the
    dietitian, social worker, and nurse before meeting with the physician. While indicating
    that she understood the dietary recommendations and had worked hard to incorporate dietary
    changes, she reported that she was following them about 60% of the time. She also reported
    that she checked her blood glucose levels 3 times per day, with an average mean blood
    glucose of 170 mg/dl. The issue of disability had been postponed, as the painful
    neuropathy was considerably improved. The physician discussed target blood glucose levels
    for her next visit, as well as the need to change D.L.&#146;s medication to improve her
    glycemic control.</p>
    <p>The dietitian coordinated D.L.&#146;s care through frequent telephone contacts and
    communicated the information to the team at weekly meetings.</p>
    <p><em>Outcome</em>. Over the next 6 months, D.L. was started on lispro insulin before
    meals, with NPH insulin in the morning. The care coordinator role was shifted from the
    dietitian to the nurse after D.L. and the dietitian determined that dietary interventions
    were being followed about 70% of the time. (Her target was 80% compliance with the meal
    plan.) D.L.&#146;s HbA1c level decreased to 7.3%, with an average SMBG reading of 148
    mg/dl. D.L. did not pursue an application for disability and decided to enter a smoking
    cessation program with the help of the social worker. She is now seen at quarterly visits
    with the diabetes care team.</p>
    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p>Now that diabetes experts agree that metabolic control matters, early diagnosis of
    diabetes with aggressive treatment designed to achieve and maintain near-normal blood
    glucose control is imperative. Achieving these goals requires a better approach to
    diabetes treatment. It has been 15 years since team care was identified as a concept whose
    time had come for the management of diabetes,29 yet a team approach to diabetes care is
    still a rarity.</p>
    <p>Ongoing treatment of diabetes by a multidisciplinary team is feasible and facilitates
    the achievement of treatment goals that will result in the development of fewer long-term
    diabetic complications. Achieving these goals does not seem possible using traditional
    models of care. There is no excuse for delay. We must transform team care from an abstract
    concept to a common practice.</p>
