    <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="5">T</font></strong><font
    face="Times New Roman" size="3">he treatment of diabetes is complex, involving numerous
    lifestyle adaptations and requiring a great deal of teaching and support. Advances in
    technology have contributed to the need for education and patient participation in care.
    Many procedures formerly performed by health care professionals, such as blood glucose
    monitoring, are now routinely done at home by patients. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the past 20 years, nursing has been a major
    contributor to the improvement in the quality of care provided to people with diabetes, as
    shown in the findings of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial.<sup>1</sup> Working
    with professionals from other disciplines, nurses have helped develop and test National
    Standards for Diabetes Patient Education. These standards still serve as a guide to the
    planning, implementation, and evaluation of comprehensive, quality programs. The
    recognition process for meeting the National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management
    Education currently offered by the American Diabetes Association<sup>2</sup> came from
    this initiative. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In 1986, an examination was developed through the
    National Certification Board for Diabetes Education (NCBDE) to certify diabetes educators.<sup>3</sup>
    According to the NCBDE national office staff, there are currently 10,000 certified
    diabetes educators (CDEs), 50% of whom are nurses (personal communication, February 10,
    1999). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Although many diabetes educators are nurses,
    until recently few have been nurse practitioners (NPs). The role of NPs has expanded to
    include the diagnosis and the medical management of both acute and chronic conditions.<sup>1</sup>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">One obvious advantage of being an NP is that NPs
    can legally adjust the diabetes medications, order diagnostic tests, and refer patients
    for consultations. Diabetes educators who are not NPs are often faced with delays in
    treatment, lack of continuity of care, and additional expense for patients in obtaining
    physicians' orders. This limitation has inspired many diabetes nurse educators to consider
    additional training to become NPs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Because the role of NPs in diabetes management is
    evolving, it is of interest to look at the components of this advanced practice role and
    give some real examples of how the care of people with diabetes can be enhanced by looking
    at several NP-managed patients. The potential contribution of NPs to primary care includes
    both cost containment and improved quality of care.<sup>1</sup> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Definition of a Nurse Practitioner</b> <br>
    Nurse practitioners are registered nurses who have completed additional education and
    clinical training so that they may diagnose and treat many common and chronic illnesses,
    focusing on health promotion and disease prevention activities, including patient
    education and counseling.<sup>4,5</sup> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Primary Care Nurse Practice acts differ from
    state to state, which explains the variation in legal and prescriptive authority and
    reimbursement. Each year, the January issue of <i>The Nurse Practitioner </i>offers a
    state-by-state update. In general, NPs have either a certificate or a master's degree as
    an NP, work in collaboration with a physician, and can prescribe medications in most
    states.<sup>6</sup> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Responsibilities include taking histories,
    performing physical assessments, developing differential diagnoses, and actually managing
    disease, as well as using research findings to improve outcomes.<sup>7</sup> Prescribing
    is particularly important in the care of people with diabetes since medications and
    devices are commonly recommended.<sup>3</sup> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In a survey of NPs practicing in Connecticut, it
    was found that most NPs see &quot;significant numbers of patients with diabetes,&quot;
    often without any organized diabetes programs.<sup>8</sup> The merging of the roles of
    certified diabetes nurse educator and NP promises to provide more specialized,
    high-quality care to patients with diabetes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">How does the NP role differ from the role of
    clinical nurse specialists (CNSs)? NPs perform certain medical tasks, such as carrying out
    physical examinations, ordering and interpreting laboratory tests, and prescribing
    medications. CNSs place a greater emphasis on the role of consultant and educator to
    patients, families, and staff. Often not directly involved in care itself, CNSs provide
    care providers with the necessary knowledge and skills to deliver care.<sup>9</sup> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The blending of the roles of NPs and CNSs has
    many advantages. They include greater likelihood of reimbursement (through NP status) and
    cost effectiveness, as well as greater role flexibility to include consultation,
    education, and research.<sup>9</sup> Cost effectiveness includes any activities that lead
    to improved outcomes and a reduction in the use of expensive health care services. Whether
    involved in direct or indirect care, it is important for advanced practice nurses to serve
    as role models and continue to be leaders who creatively adapt to our rapidly changing
    health care delivery system. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Following are some case studies of NP-managed
    patients. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>The Patient With Syndrome X</b> <br>
    <i>Nancy Reilly Wohl, RN, MSN, ANP-C, CDE</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A.W. is a 56-year-old white man who presented
    with chest pain and newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation 6 years ago. He had a vague family
    history of diabetes, weighed 320 lb, had a blood glucose level of 352 mg/dl, and was
    diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. His primary care physician discharged him on an oral agent
    and scheduled follow-up visits. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The NP met A.W. 3 years later at a diabetes
    class, where he presented on the maximum dose of the oral agent with a hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub>
    of 14.7%, weight of 290 lb, blood pressure of 146/92, increased triglyceride and
    low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
    cholesterol, and proteinuria. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A.W. was diagnosed with Syndrome X, the term used
    to describe an insulin-resistant state characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL
    cholesterol, hyperglycemia, central obesity, and hypertension.<sup>10,11</sup> Syndrome X
    patients require, at least initially, a vigilant management approach to help educate them
    about the many components of their condition while offering encouragement and support. NPs
    have the knowledge and ability to work with Syndrome X patients independently through
    frequent visits and telephone follow-up. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The NP, in collaboration with other members of
    the health care team, provided A.W. with a blood glucose meter and education and provided
    nutritional counseling and other information about diabetes management. Each visit
    included performing a focused physical examination, ordering and reviewing laboratory
    data, and adjusting medications. The NP was able to deliver this care independently,
    saving A.W. time and the institution money. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Over the next year and a half, A.W. was able to
    dramatically improve his health status. The NP placed him on insulin therapy and quickly
    changed to BIDS therapy (bedtime insulin, daytime sulfonylurea). An angiotensin-converting
    enzyme inhibitor helped manage his hypertension as well as his renal insufficiency.
    Unfortunately, A.W. was not a candidate for metformin because of a history of alcohol use.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As his blood glucose levels improved, so did his
    lipid profile. Weekly visits coordinated by the NP with other health care providers (e.g.,
    psychiatrist, podiatrist, dietitian, ophthalmologist) along with frequent telephone triage
    calls by the NP to review blood glucose values and make adjustments in the treatment
    regimen substantially improved his status. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A.W. has recently married, lost 25 lb, has a
    normal lipid profile, and has controlled hypertension, reduced proteinuria, and a
    hemoglobin A<sub>1c </sub>of 8.0%. He is on 5 mg of glipizide in the morning and 10 U of
    lente insulin at bedtime. He comes to regularly scheduled appointments with the NP and no
    longer requires telephone triage but feels free to call when assistance is needed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The NP was able to provide the medical
    management, education, and coordination of the interdisciplinary services that were needed
    to achieve success in the complex care required for this Syndrome X patient. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>The Patient With a Nonhealing Foot Ulcer</b> <br>
    <i>Terry Gray, RN, PhD, ANP-C, CDE</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">B.F. is a 63-year-old black man with a 20-year
    history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, arteriosclerotic heart disease (ASHD),
    peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and peripheral neuropathy. Although he had noticed a
    yellowish drainage on his sock and an odor from his shoes approximately 1 month before his
    visit, he delayed seeking treatment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">B.F. had stopped seeking medical care 3 years ago
    when he was advised to begin insulin therapy but refused. Within a short time after
    starting insulin, B.F.'s father suffered a lower-extremity amputation and died, and B.F.
    feared the same fate. Now he has just &quot;found a big hole&quot; in the bottom of his
    foot and knew he needed help. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The NP examined B.F. and diagnosed acute
    cellulitis and a chronic infected ulcer. Pressure sensation was measured using the
    Semmes-Weinstein monofilament. B.F. was placed in risk category 3 due to the presence of
    the ulcer and inability to perceive filament sensation.<sup>12</sup> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It was decided to treat B.F. as an outpatient
    with elevation of the extremity, bed rest, and complete nonweight bearing because any
    pressure from continued use of the injured area would spread the infection into adjacent
    tissues. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">An X ray was ordered to rule out osteomyelitis.
    Amoxicillin, a broad spectrum antibiotic covering both aerobic and anaerobic organisms,
    was chosen because most chronic infected ulcers are polymicrobial in nature.<sup>13</sup>
    The NP reviewed blood glucose monitoring technique and asked B.F. to test at home four
    times a day and to call in the results weekly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The NP closely followed B.F., and the ulcer
    healed within 2 months. Follow-up included discussions about blood glucose values and the
    importance of adherence to recommendations regarding diet, activity, foot care, prevention
    and treatment of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and stress management. B.F. was referred
    for extra-depth, molded shoes in an effort to prevent a recurrence of the ulceration.<sup>14,15</sup>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Complicating factors in this case included the
    presence of significant ASHD, dyslipidemia, PVD, and an insensate foot. The radiological
    examination demonstrated soft tissue swelling but no evidence of osteomyelitis. After a
    Doppler study revealed significant lack of blood flow to the left lower extremity (LLE),
    B.F. was referred to a vascular surgeon for evaluation and treatment. He underwent a
    successful femoral-popliteal bypass graft of the LLE. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The dyslipidemia was addressed using dietary
    modifications, exercise, and a fibric acid derivative, gemfibrozil.<sup>16</sup> After 6
    months, the lipid profile improved. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">B.F.'s inability to perceive pain and fear of
    insulin therapy precluded his seeking medical treatment in a timely manner. Once under the
    care of the NP, B.F. discussed his fears and learned the benefits of glycemic control. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">He was immediately enrolled in the hospital-based
    diabetes self-management training program, where the NP is one of the instructors. He
    completed the course and became more attentive to his diet, blood glucose monitoring, and
    an &quot;arm-chair&quot; exercise program, and lost 14 lb. These activities were
    instrumental in lowering his HbA<sub>1c </sub>from 14.5 to 8.9%. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">B.F. now understands the danger of an insensate
    foot and is meticulous in his daily foot care, making sure to include a thorough foot
    inspection every morning and evening. The close relationship he developed with the NP
    helped support him through this complex treatment plan. The NP offered not only medical
    management, but a great deal of education and encouragement, which facilitated B.F.'s
    adjustment to lifestyle changes that were necessary for him to achieve success. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Initiating Insulin Pump Therapy</b> <br>
    <i>Phyllis Furst, RN, MA, ANP-C, CDE</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">C.O., a 26-year-old white man with type 1
    diabetes for 8 years, was referred to the NP for counseling and initiation of insulin pump
    therapy. He frequently had to work late hours and found that he had difficulty maintaining
    good glycemic control on multiple daily injections due to his demanding and unpredictable
    schedule. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The NP discussed the pros and cons of insulin
    pump therapy.<sup>17</sup> C.O. was enthusiastic about the increased flexibility the pump
    would provide. Issues such as exercise and dating were explored. Both available insulin
    pumps were demonstrated, as well as the various choices of infusion sets. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">After obtaining insurance coverage for the pump,
    C.O. was ready to begin the intensive, 8-hour pump training program, consisting of six
    individual outpatient visits with the NP. During the training, the NP reviewed skills such
    as blood glucose monitoring, hypoglycemia management, ketoacidosis prevention, and
    sick-day management. The nutritionist reviewed the meal plan and instructed C.O. in
    carbohydrate counting. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Next, the NP began to demonstrate pump
    programming and function applications, insulin supplementation for high blood glucose
    levels, the protocol for clogged infusion sets, and pump alarms and discussed when to seek
    medical help.<sup>17</sup> Based on his total daily dose of insulin before initiation of
    insulin pump therapy, the NP calculated C.O.'s starting basal insulin rate of 0.6 U/hour
    as well as his initial meal bolus amounts. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">C.O. left that visit wearing the pump with normal
    saline and mimicked actual pump usage for the next 10 days. He continued his previous
    multiple daily injection program during this time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">For the fourth visit, C.O. came to the office
    fasting, with plans to have breakfast after the insulin was placed in the pump for the
    first time. His physician was called to review the planned insulin rates. Because C.O.
    planned to return to the referring physician for his diabetes management once stable on
    the pump, it was important to involve his physician in the dosage adjustments. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">C.O. was asked to review blood glucose levels and
    insulin rates by phone with the NP or the physician for the next 5�7 days. A return visit
    was scheduled with the NP 2 days later to troubleshoot pump questions, as well as to
    review blood glucose levels and make basal and bolus rate adjustments as needed. C.O.
    again demonstrated his skill in preparing and inserting a new pump syringe and infusion
    set. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">C.O. continued to call the NP once daily for the
    next 5 days and was able to achieve his target blood glucose levels in 10 days. Although
    this seems labor-intensive, it offers an important safety and support net for outpatient
    insulin pump initiation. C.O. scheduled an appointment for a follow-up visit with the NP 2
    weeks after the initial insulin-start visit. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A change to insulin pump therapy is a major
    therapeutic and lifestyle adjustment for people with diabetes. The NP's careful attention
    to the physiological, educational, psychological, emotional, and comfort aspects of
    insulin pump therapy eased the transition. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Managing the Pregnant Patient With Diabetes</b>
    <br>
    <i>Donna Jornsay, RN, BSN, CPNP, CDE</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">T.V., a 36-year-old woman at 18 weeks gestation,
    was referred by her private obstetrician for diabetes education and counseling with the
    diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Her medical history was insignificant except for a
    pre-pregnancy weight of 350 lb. Her height is 5'9&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The patient was screened earlier than usual
    because of risk factors for diabetes, including her weight and the presence of glycosuria.

    changed and are based on the criteria adopted by Carpenter and Coustan.<sup>18</sup> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Given the abnormality of the GTT and her symptoms
    of diabetes, T.V. was informed that her diabetes was most likely type 2 rather than
    gestational diabetes. The NP began treatment by teaching T.V. about the maternal and fetal
    risks of diabetes during pregnancy, including the increased risk (up to 25%) of congenital
    malformations. T.V. was informed that although she did have an increased risk for a
    congenital malformation, an ultrasound and fetal echocardiogram performed at 18�22 weeks
    gestation would provide an accurate diagnosis of the fetus's condition. The NP outlined
    the advantages of maintaining excellent glycemic control for the remainder of the
    pregnancy, including decreasing the fetal risks of macrosomia and stillbirth and the
    neonatal risks of hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, and hypocalcemia.<sup>18,19</sup>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The NP discussed the probability of previously
    undiagnosed type 2 and outlined the necessary treatment. This included dietary management,
    fasting and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose monitoring, urine ketone monitoring,
    multiple daily insulin injections (NPH and regular before breakfast, regular before
    dinner, and NPH at bedtime), and outpatient fetal monitoring. The NP instructed T.V. in
    blood glucose monitoring, urine ketone testing, insulin self-administration, and exercise
    guidelines. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A registered dietitian gave her a 2,400-calorie
    American Diabetes Association (ADA) meal plan as calculated based on her weight and
    caloric needs for pregnancy. The meal plan included three main meals and three snacks per
    day. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">All of this information was presented slowly,
    allowing time for questions and expressions of feelings. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As the NP was teaching T.V. blood glucose
    monitoring, her blood glucose level was 237 mg/dl 2 hours after breakfast. After
    discussing the situation with T.V., the NP decided to admit her to the inpatient high-risk
    obstetric unit to expedite her education and glycemic control. Her HbA<sub>1c </sub>at
    this time was 11.7% (normal 4.4�6.4.%), thereby giving the fetus a 22% risk of a
    congenital malformation.<sup>19</sup> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The NP provided medical management and
    coordinated T.V.'s care, including ordering a comprehensive ultrasound as soon as possible
    (ideally done at 18�20 weeks gestation) and a fetal echocardiogram at 20�22 weeks to
    rule out any malformations.<sup>20</sup> The NP reviewed the results of these tests and
    discussed them with T.V. Fortunately, both of these exams were within normal limits. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">T.V. needed much support and reassurance as she
    began to grasp the concept that her diabetes would most likely not go away at the end of
    her pregnancy. Fortunately, her dilated eye exam, 24-hour urine, and EKG were all within
    normal limits, thereby indicating that she had not developed any chronic complications of
    diabetes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Insulin treatment was initiated at 0.8 U/kg
    current weight, which is recommended for 18 weeks gestation. Her current weight was 165
    kg. Her initial insulin regimen was 56 U NPH/28 U regular 30 minutes before breakfast; 22
    U regular 30 minutes before dinner; and 22 U NPH at bedtime. Based on T.V.'s obesity, the
    NP steadily increased these doses up to approximately 300 U of insulin by the time of
    delivery. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The first week after discharge, the NP maintained
    daily phone contact with the patient to review her blood glucose results and to adjust her
    insulin doses and meal plan as needed.<sup>21</sup> From 19 weeks gestation onward, the
    patient was able to be managed as an outpatient with weekly phone contact and biweekly
    visits to the NP in addition to her regular obstetric visits. The insulin doses increased
    as the pregnancy progressed, and she was able to maintain her blood glucose values within
    the expected range of 60�120 mg/dl. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The NP initiated daily fetal movement recording
    at 26 weeks. Based on her initial poor glycemic control, twice weekly nonstress testing
    was begun at 32 weeks, and serial ultrasounds were done to assess fetal growth. All her
    fetal surveillance testing was within normal limits. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">T.V.'s care was specialized and labor-intensive.
    The NP was able to provide the continuity and attention that T.V. needed to see her
    through this high-risk pregnancy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">T.V. had a vaginal delivery of a 7 lb, 3 oz baby
    at 37 weeks gestation. Her baby girl was in the neonatal intensive care unit for several
    days with hyperbilirubinemia and difficulty feeding, but did well. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Two years postpartum, T.V. has lost approximately
    50 lb. and is continuing to lose weight. She has type 2 diabetes for which she is
    currently being treated with three injections per day of insulin after failing on oral
    agents. Since this NP only treats diabetes in pregnancy, she referred T.V. to the NP in
    adult endocrinology to control her glucose values so that she can avoid long-term
    complications of diabetes and be able to share a long and healthy life with her husband

    <i>Jane Jeffrie Seley, RN, BSN, MPH, MSN, GNP, CDE, CHES</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Managing patients with diabetes effectively
    requires a great deal of time, effort, and patience. As discussed in the cases outlined
    above, diabetes NPs are able to deliver quality, cost-effective care by applying all of
    the combined skills and knowledge from their training as nurses, NPs, and diabetes
    educators. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Studies looking at the effectiveness of NPs in
    primary care reveal not only competence but equivalent or slightly improved patient
    outcomes, most likely because the NPs spend more time talking with patients and
    individualizing treatment regimens.<sup>22</sup> The trend for more diabetes nurse
    educators to become diabetes NPs can only lead to better care for people with diabetes. In
    the future, diabetes NPs could be utilized in primary care settings where there is a high
    volume of patients with diabetes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As a gerontological NP presently consulting in a
    busy general medicine practice (Beth Israel Medical Center's General Medical Associates
    [GMA]), I am able to provide a higher level of care to my patients with diabetes because I
    also bring to them 20 years of experience as a diabetes nurse educator. My colleagues
    value my ability to support my patients through the complex management plan. I am thought
    of as an expert in diabetes management as well as in successfully helping patients adhere
    to the complex medical regimens prescribed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Collaboration with the physicians and other NPs
    in the practice works both ways and benefits both providers and patients. More diabetes
    patients are thereby able to receive a higher level of care at a lower cost in a general
    medical practice. Patients continue to be referred to endocrinologists when blood glucose
    levels are not well controlled within a reasonable period of time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Many NPs like myself are already providing
    primary care to populations known to be at higher risk for diabetes, e.g., minorities and
    the elderly. However, more research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of diabetes
    NPs in collaborative practice in primary care and to establish if they are truly
    delivering quality, cost-effective care according to the standards set by the American
    Diabetes Association.<sup>1</sup> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">GMA joined its affiliate St. Luke's-Roosevelt in
    instituting the Diabetes Initiative Plan to improve care delivery to patients with
    diabetes. GMA physicians and NPs worked together to develop a diabetes checklist, which is
    included on the medical record of all GMA patients with diabetes. The checklist reminds
    providers when to perform appropriate testing and evaluations such as HbA<sub>1c</sub>
    levels, foot examinations, and podiatric referral, according to ADA standards of medical
    care for patients with diabetes. This program has been very successful to date. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The next step will be to improve the knowledge of
    the current treatment of diabetes among GMA providers. Professional education that
    increases awareness of the importance of diabetes management is a valuable tool in
    reducing and preventing the complications of diabetes.<sup>1</sup> Diabetes NPs can serve
    as role models and educators, offering professional education in diabetes care and
    management to their colleagues in primary care. This is a perfect blend of the CNS and NP
    roles. </font></p>
